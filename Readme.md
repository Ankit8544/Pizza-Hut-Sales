## **SQL Queries and Analysis**  

### **Basic Analysis Queries**  
- **Retrieve Total Orders**:  
   ```sql  
   SELECT COUNT(orders.order_id) AS Total_Orders FROM orders;  
   ```  
- **Calculate Total Revenue**:  
   ```sql  
   SELECT ROUND(SUM(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price), 2) AS Total_Revenue  
   FROM order_details  
   JOIN pizzas ON pizzas.pizza_id = order_details.pizza_id;  
   ```  
- **Highest Priced Pizza**:  
   ```sql  
   SELECT pizza_types.name, pizzas.price  
   FROM pizza_types  
   JOIN pizzas ON pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id  
   ORDER BY pizzas.price DESC LIMIT 1;  
   ```  

### **Intermediate Analysis Queries**  
- **Quantity by Pizza Category**:  
   ```sql  
   SELECT pizza_types.category, SUM(order_details.quantity) AS Quantity_Ordered  
   FROM pizza_types  
   JOIN pizzas ON pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id  
   JOIN order_details ON order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id  
   GROUP BY pizza_types.category  
   ORDER BY Quantity_Ordered DESC;  
   ```  
- **Order Distribution by Hour**:  
   ```sql  
   SELECT HOUR(orders.order_time) AS Hour, COUNT(orders.order_id) AS Order_Count  
   FROM orders GROUP BY HOUR(order_time);  
   ```  

### **Advanced Analysis Queries**  
- **Revenue Contribution by Pizza Type**:  
   ```sql  
   SELECT pizza_types.category, CONCAT(ROUND((SUM(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price) /  
   (SELECT ROUND(SUM(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price), 2) AS Total_Revenue  
   FROM order_details JOIN pizzas ON pizzas.pizza_id = order_details.pizza_id)) * 100, 2), ' %')  
   AS Percentage_Contribution_in_Revenue  
   FROM pizza_types  
   JOIN pizzas ON pizzas.pizza_type_id = pizza_types.pizza_type_id  
   JOIN order_details ON order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id  
   GROUP BY pizza_types.category;  
   ```
